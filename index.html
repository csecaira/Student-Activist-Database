            Student activists in higher education around the world face several
            obstacles in their day to day life. Therefore, the aim of this 
            resource bank is to help connect students activists with some 
            resources that can help support their activism.<br>
            <br>
            After selecting a category, you'll see different links, which will 
            lead you to said resource's website, where you can find more
            information about any applications. <br>

        <p> 
            Relocation programs help student activists relocate to locations
            where they can rest or continue with their activism work safely. 
            Please note that most programs have limited relocation locations
            and support periods (i.e. 6 months).

        <h2 class="sub_intro_text"><a href="emergency_grants.html"> Emergency Grants </a></h2>

        <p> 
            Emergency grants allow eligible student activists to apply and 
            receive funding within a couple of weeks. Please note that some
            of the grants remain open throughout the year, and they each have 
            different time frames in which they inform you whether you were 
            accepted/denied and then your grant.

        <h2 class="sub_intro_text"><a href="non_emergency_grants.html"> Non-Emergency Grants </a></h2>
        
        <p> 
            Unlike emergency grants, non-emergency grants may take longer in
            giving an eligible individual or organization their award. 
            Additionally, their applications tend to be only open for specific
            time periods (i.e. August-October).
